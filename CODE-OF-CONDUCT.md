# Outreachy Community Code of Conduct
  
_last edited - January 28, 2022_

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as Outreachy applicants, interns, alumni, mentors, coordinators, organizers, and other contributors (collectively known as Outreachy community members) pledge to make participation in Outreachy and the Outreachy community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Diversity is encouraged

Outreachy aims to provide a safer environment for all participants, regardless of:

* age
* body size
* caste
* disability
* ethnicity
* gender identity and expression
* level of experience
* education
* socio-economic status
* nationality
* personal appearance
* race
* religion (or lack thereof)
* sexual identity and orientation
* tribe

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by Outreachy community members include:

* Insulting/derogatory comments
* Trolling
* Statements or jokes that exclude based on the demographic groups in the "Diversity is encouraged" section
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Sexual language and imagery
* Sexual attention or advances towards people under 18 years of age
* Unwelcome sexual attention or behavior that contributes to a sexualized environment
* Violence directed against another person, including violent threats and violent language
* Providing false information on the Outreachy mentor or intern agreement, the internship application, W-9 or W8-BEN forms, third-party payment authorization, or payment authorization request

Outreachy prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. The Outreachy organizers will not act on complaints regarding:

* "Reverse"-isms, including "reverse racism," "reverse sexism," and "cisphobia"
* The tone or writing style used when responding to harassment, racism, sexism, transphobia, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you."

## Our Responsibilities

Outreachy organizers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Outreachy organizers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

Outreachy organizers have the right to ban temporarily or permanently any Outreachy community member for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Examples of bans include but are not limited to:

* A temporary or permanent ban from an Outreachy project space
* A temporary or permanent ban from applying for an Outreachy internship
* A temporary or permanent ban from participating as an Outreachy mentor, coordinator, organizer, alumni, or contributor
* Removal of an Outreachy intern from the program, severance of their Outreachy internship agreement, and no disbursement of any remaining internship stipends

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within Outreachy project spaces:

* [The Outreachy website](https://www.outreachy.org)
* The Outreachy public and private mailing lists
* The Outreachy IRC channels, including private channels and public channels:
  * [irc://irc.gnome.org/outreachy](irc://irc.gnome.org/outreachy)
  * [irc://irc.gnome.org/outreachy-admins](irc://irc.gnome.org/outreachy-admins)
* The Outreachy public and private git repositories:
  * [https://github.com/outreachy/website/](https://github.com/outreachy/website/)
  * [https://github.com/outreachy/creative-works-and-scripts](https://github.com/outreachy/creative-works-and-scripts)
  * [https://gitlab.com/sagesharp/outreachy-notes](https://gitlab.com/sagesharp/outreachy-notes)
* The Outreachy private Zulip chat
* Any additional Outreachy project spaces added in the future

When Outreachy community members make contributions and participate in public discussion during the application period, during the internship period, and at other times when their affiliation with Outreachy is relevant, they represent the Outreachy project and its reputation. Therefore, this Code of Conduct applies to:

* Public communication between Outreachy community members in community spaces of free software projects or non-profits who are participating as Outreachy mentoring communities
* Public communication between Outreachy community members at gatherings related to Outreachy and at free software events
* Public Outreachy intern blog posts and comments by Outreachy community members on those blog posts
* Private communication between Outreachy community members related to an Outreachy application or internship
* Private communication between Outreachy community members and Software Freedom Conservancy staff that is related to an Outreachy internship, either through the accounting request ticket system or private email

This Code of Conduct also applies to official Outreachy communication, such as:

* Using an official outreachy.org e-mail address
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event, including all cases when your travel costs are partially or fully sponsored by Outreachy
* Posting via an official Outreachy social media account:
  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/outreachy)
  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/18204091/)

Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by the Outreachy organizers.

If a concern about a past incident in any space is brought up about a current Outreachy community member, Outreachy organizers may take it into account when deciding whether the incident should have any consequences to the community member's participation in the Outreachy community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Outreachy organizers through our [website contact form](https://www.outreachy.org/contact/contact-us/).

The contact form reaches all Outreachy organizers, including organizers who are not on the Outreachy Code of Conduct committee. You can individually email the Outreachy Code of Conduct committee members with an incident report by using these email addresses:

* Sage Sharp <sage@outreachy.org>
* Karen Sandler <karen@outreachy.org>

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The Outreachy organizers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
