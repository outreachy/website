#amazing dashboard project
"""
To add a new dashboard section, there are three steps:

- Define a function that takes a request and returns a context
  value. If the value evaluates false, like False, None, [], or {},
  then this section will be skipped.

- The name of that function determines what template renders this
  section. For example, the function named "approval_status" gets
  the template named "home/dashboard/approval_status.html". Within
  the template, the section's context value is available under
  the name "section".

- Add the function name to the DASHBOARD_SECTIONS list at the end of
  this file. The order in which functions appear in that list
  determines the order that sections will be displayed on the
  dashboard, so you can reorder them easily.

The context value can be any type. Here are some examples:

- If the function returns {'x': ...}, the template can access that
  as "section.x".

- If it returns a list, then "{% for x in section %}" will loop over
  that list.
