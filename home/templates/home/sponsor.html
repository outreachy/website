<h2 id="why-sponsor-outreachy">Why Sponsor Outreachy?</h2>

<p>Sponsoring Outreachy directly supports diversity in open source, enabling anyone from any background who has experienced systemic bias and discrimination to apply!</p>

<p>Based on our 2019 longitudinal survey, past Outreachy interns are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>92% women</li>
	<li>4% transgender, genderqueer, or non-binary people</li>
	<li>64% people of color</li>
	<li>12% people from a historically disadvantaged caste or tribe</li>
</ul>

<p>Outreachy attracts many motivated and talented 
applicants. Most of our interns have had their work included in the 
software releases, with some of them completing major features during 
their internships. About half of the program participants stay involved 
with the organization they worked with past their internship. Outreachy organizers know of the following accomplishments among 912 past participants who successfully completed Outreachy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>100 found employment or contract positions with sponsoring organizations </li>
	<li>97 had full-session talks on FOSS topics at conferences, of them, 32 in 2015, 36 in 2016, and 41 in 2017</li>
	<li>36 became mentors for Outreachy or Google Summer of Code </li>
	<li>29 continued on to participate in Google Summer of Code </li>
	<li>3 organized local technology initiatives - Meg Ford started Chicagoans Hacking on GNOME, Martha Chumo Chelimo started Nairobi Dev School, Satabdi Das started Women in Free Software - India </li>
	<li>Ekaterina Gerasimova and Meg Ford became GNOME Foundation board members </li>
	<li>Valerie Young became a Software in the Public Interest board member </li>
	<li>Yan Zhu was named among "Women in IT Security: Women to watch" by SC Magazine in 2015  </li>
	<li>Tapasweni Pathak received a Systers Anita Borg Fall 2015 Pass-It-On Award </li>
	<li>Victoria Mart√≠nez de la Cruz received OpenStack mentor of mentors award</li>
</ul>

<p>The outreach efforts like this one also result in the improvements for all newcomers.
For example, the <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Newcomers/Mentors">mentors list</a>
 that GNOME started with 9 mentors is now a general resource that contains over 40 
mentors. GNOME also improved how it engages Google Summer of Code students with the community based on its experience in the program, by requiring them to work with mentors on an initial 
contribution during the application period and by incorporating the 
required blog posts about their work on Planet GNOME. Making the 
community a friendly place for people who experience bias and discrimination also makes it 
such for all newcomers.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<p><b>Q: Who pays the interns?</b></p>

<p>A: The Outreachy parent non-profit, the Software Freedom Conservancy, handles payments to interns.</p>

<p><b>Q: Are Outreachy interns employees or interns of the corporate sponsors?</b></p>
<p>A: No. Outreachy interns are considered contractors of the Software Freedom Conservancy during their internship.</p>

<p><b>Q: Are corporate sponsors required to help run the internship program?</b></p>

<p>A: No. The Outreachy application process, intern selection coordination, 
communication with mentors, and payments to interns are all handled by 
Outreachy organizers.</p>

<p><b>Q: We have a company internship program. Can you place Outreachy applicants into our internship program?</b></p>

<p>A: No. Outreachy internships are completely separate from any other internship program.</p>

<p><b>Q. If I'm a corporate sponsor, do I have to provide a mentor for the internship program?</b></p>

<p>A: No. While
 employees from many corporate sponsors mentor for Outreachy, it's not 
required for corporate sponsors to provide either mentors or internship 
project ideas. FOSS communities generally provide their own mentors and 
project ideas. If a sponsor does have an internship idea and a mentor, 
they should <a href="/mentor/">review the community guidelines</a>.</p>

<p><b>Q: How does the Outreachy opportunities mailing list work?</b></p>

<p>A: Outreachy runs an opt-in mailing list open to all current and past Outreachy interns, coordinators, mentors, and sponsors.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this list is to connect Outreachy sponsors with 
Outreachy participants. 
Sponsors are invited to share job, internship, event, and other 
opportunities that they think might be of interest to the Outreachy 
community. Additionally, all Outreachy community members are invited to 
share job and internship opportunities.</p>

<p>We expect sponsors to not send e-mail about the same 
opportunity more than twice. Sponsors should send information about new 
opportunities no more than twice a week. If you are representing a 
sponsoring organization and would like to share opportunities with your 
member companies, please do so no more than once a month in a form of a 
digest.</p>

<p>The Outreachy opportunities list reaches participants around the world, so please provide details that can help people decide if any given 
e-mail is relevant to them in the subject line. For example, if an 
opportunity requires people to be in a particular location, please 
include the location in the subject line.
</p>
		
<p><b>Q: Who is eligible for Outreachy internships?</b></p>

<p>Anyone from any background who has experienced systemic bias and discrimination is eligible to apply to Outreachy. There is no list of groups that are eligible or ineligible and Outreachy interns have been from countless backgrounds and identities. Obstacles that face people who wish to get started in FOSS can be significant. Our program does not presume what those obstacles may be, and instead we rely on applicants to tell us about the obstacles they face and how those obstacles impact them. We recognize that our technology will not be made <i>for</i> everyone if it is not made <i>by</i> everyone.</p>
