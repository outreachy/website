If you apply to Outreachy and you are not accepted as an intern, you may apply again.</li>
	<li>Applicants who have part-time or contracting jobs are welcome to apply. However, part-time jobs must be approved by Outreachy organizers.

	<li>Applicants are required to list their current jobs and internships on their initial application. If an applicant receives a job or internship offer after submitting an initial application, they should <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/contact/organizers/">notify Outreachy organizers</a> immediately. Applicants are required to document any changes from the time commitments listed on their initial application, by filling out the question about time commitment changes in their final applications.</li>
