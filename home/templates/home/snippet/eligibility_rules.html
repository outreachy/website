<p>Outreachy is open to applicants around the world. You will need to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You are or will be 18 years of age or older by {{ current_round.internstarts }}</li>
	<li>You are available for a full-time, 30 hours a week internship from {{ current_round.internstarts }} to {{ current_round.internends }}.</li>
	<li>You were not an intern with Outreachy, the Outreach Program for Women, or Google Summer of Code. People who were a Google Summer of Code intern are not eligible for Outreachy. All Google Summer of Code interns are ineligible for Outreachy, including people who did not successfully finish their GSoC internship. If you apply to Outreachy and you are not accepted as an intern, you may apply again.</li>
	<li>Applicants who have part-time or contracting jobs are welcome to apply. However, part-time jobs must be approved by Outreachy organizers. People who are willing to quit their full-time job are welcome to apply. If you cannot quit your full-time job, you are not eligible for Outreachy. People who are taking a leave of absence from a full-time job are not eligible for Outreachy.</li>
	<li>Applicants are required to list their current jobs and internships on their initial application. If an applicant receives a job or internship offer after submitting an initial application, they should notify <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/contact/organizers/">Outreachy organizers</a> immediately. Applicants are required to document any changes from the time commitments listed on their initial application, by filling out the question about time commitment changes in their final applications.</li>
	<li>Outreachy is open to both university students and people who are not university students. University students must have {{ current_round.minimum_days_free_for_students }} consecutive days free from school and exams during the internship period. Students must apply to the correct internship round (see rules below).</li>
	<li>If you are a student on a student visa, your visa must allow you to work 30 hours per week. If you cannot work 30 hours per week, you are not eligible for Outreachy. If you are on a student visa in the United States of America, you might have limited dates when you can work 30 hours a week. We will work with you to shift your internship dates by up to five weeks. However, we cannot accommodate shortening the 13 week internship. If you are a student on an F-1 visa, you may need to apply for CPT with your university. Outreachy organizers can provide you documentation for your CPT application once you are selected as an intern.</li>
</ul>

<p>Outreachy internships run twice a year, May to August and December to March. We have some rules around which internship round you can apply to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you are not a university student, you may apply to either internship round.</li>
