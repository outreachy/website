<p>As a general policy, Outreachy strongly discourages the use of generative AI tools. These tools should be only used after an explicit conversation with your mentor. Applicants who submit unedited AI-generated contributions that they cannot explain or correct will NOT be accepted for Outreachy internships. Outreachy interns who over-rely on having AI generate their contributions may have their internship terminated.<p>

<p>Each Outreachy mentor will set a policy on whether they allow applicants and interns to use generative AI in their project contributions.<p>

<p>Outreachy applicants should check the project description to understand the mentor's generative AI policy. If no description is provided, applicants should check with their mentor before submitting any AI generated project contributions.</p>

<p>Outreachy interns should talk with their mentor at the beginning of the internship to understand what parts of the project they can use generative AI with, if any.</p>

<p>Generative AI is well known for "AI hallucinations". Generative AI is well known to output incorrect facts or make up concepts.</p>

<p>When generative AI is used in programming, it can create buggy code and make up function or API calls that don't exist. AI generated code often looks correct at first glance. It can take Outreachy mentors a long time to identify the issues.</p>

<p>Many experienced Outreachy mentors have commented that AI generative code is both poor in quality and difficult to review. Mentors are also concerned that applicants may not understand the code that is being generated. Outreachy mentors fear that using generative AI can slow down or interfere with the learning process of applicants and interns.</p>

<p>At the same time, there may be use cases where generative AI is helpful. For example, some people may use generative AI to find information about a technical topic in project documentation. Non-native English speakers may use generative AI to polish their commit messages to sound more professional. Generative AI is also helpful in extracting data or numbers from text into tables or charts. However, even these use cases require very careful checking to ensure there are no mistakes or made-up information.</p>

<p>A few open source projects are experimenting with allowing or even encouraging code contributions using generative AI or other AI programming tools. Each Outreachy project will have a different policy about whether they will accept project contributions generated with AI.</p>

<p>Please check the internship project description to understand whether you can use generative AI in your project contributions. Please talk with your mentor to understand whether you can use generative AI, and how best to use it.</p>

<p>Regardless of project generative AI policy, Outreachy expects applicants and interns to use generative AI in a deliberate, documented, and precise manner. Using the tips below will ensure that applicants and interns respect Outreachy mentor's time and expertise.</p>

<p>Using generative AI respectfully:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Document how you used generative AI in your project contribution.</b> In your pull request or contribution description, mention you used generative AI. Make sure to note the name and version of the generative AI tool you used. Share the steps you took or prompts you wrote to ask the generative AI tool to create or edit your contribution.</li>
	<li><b>Understand what the AI generated contribution is doing.</b> It's important to understand the output of any software tool. This especially true of contributions generated with AI. Outreachy applicants and interns should be able to explain why the AI generated contribution is related to the problem they are trying to solve. You should be able to explain in detail what the generated contribution does. You should be able to correct any mistakes and create additional content to improve the contribution.</li>
	<li><b>Make sure the AI generated contribution is correct.</b> All contributions, including AI generated ones, must meet the testing, documentation, style and quality guidelines of the open source community. Make sure your code compiles and passes the project test suite. Make sure your contribution meets the documentation and style guidelines of the open source community. Additionally, AI generated code must be very carefully checked to make sure the tool hasn't made up functions, API calls, references, or documentation sections that don't exist.</li>
</ul>
