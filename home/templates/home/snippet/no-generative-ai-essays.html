<p><b>Applicants should not use generative AI to create or edit their initial application essays.</b></p>

<p>We know some applicants may want to use generative AI (also called Large Language Models or LLMs). You may feel pressured to use generative AI to polish your initial application essays. However, Outreachy organizers do not judge the writing style, grammar or spelling used in essays. Instead, we look for essays that reflect your lived experience with underrepresentation, discrimination, and systemic bias.</p>

<p>Only you can accurately and authentically write about your own lived experiences. Using generative AI, even to polish your essay's writing, can introduce inaccuracies and an inauthentic writing style. Generative AI tools tend to produce wordy writing with little substance. Using generative AI to polish your essay may actually remove or downplay your strong personal experiences. This may prevent the reviewers from understanding your personal perspective. Applicants who use generative AI may not have their initial application accepted.</p>
