<p>As everyone is aware, <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/blog/2024-08-14/outreachy-needs-your-help/#funding-loss">donations to Outreachy have decreased over the last few years</a>. Because of this, <b>Outreachy is not currently able to fund any internships out of our general activities fund.</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.outreachy.org/blog/2025-08-14/december-2025-call-for-mentoring-organizations/#critical-financial-challenges">Outreachy's finances are at a critical point.</a> We would be so grateful if all of our communities help us identify fundraising leads so that Outreachy can continue to run.</p>

<p><u>Donation amounts</u></p>

<p>In order to run our program in the most basic way, Outreachy needs to receive donations of at least $8,000 to $10,000 USD per intern we accept. This breaks down to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>$7,000 USD donation towards the Outreachy internship stipend</li>
	<li>$1,000 to $3,000 USD donation towards the Outreachy program activities fund, which covers some of the basic costs of running the Outreachy program, including all banking and other fees, and without which we couldn't run the internship program at all.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Outreachy is currently facing critical financial challenges. At this time, communities must donate at least $8,000 USD per intern they wish to mentor. We really hope communities increase their donation beyond that to ensure Outreachy can continue running.</b></p>

<p>Outreachy is a labor intensive program. Outreachy organizers are highly involved with interns. Outreachy organizers work closely with your community's mentors to empower your interns to pursue a future in FOSS. While most of our internships complete without issues, each cohort there are multiple internships where the organizers step in provide support to both interns and mentors. They also are almost always available via Zulip to both interns and mentors.</p>

<p>Outreachy's deep support of interns, along with your mentoring partnership, means 80% of past Outreachy interns continue to contribute to open source after their internship.</p>

<p>We need your community's help to identify and convince organizations to provide donations to help Outreachy sustain our deep support of interns, and retain their amazing talent in our open source community. Please don't think about this as just finding funding for your interns for this internship cohort. This is about <b>ensuring the future of Outreachy</b>, and we ask for your help <b>to fund our essential program activities.</b></p>
