Outreachy week 7: Assignments for mentors & interns

Welcome to week seven of your Outreachy internship! Interns without an internship extension are now half-way done with the internship.

We have some goals and assignments for both mentors and interns. Please read the sections below.

Mid-point feedback
------------------

For most interns, mid-point feedback is due on {{ current_round.midfeedback }}. The midpoint feedback form will be available on {{ current_round.intern_midpoint_feedback_opens }}, at which point you'll see a button on your dashboard:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'dashboard' %}#feedback

The goal of midpoint feedback is to ensure that interns are working full-time on their projects, communicating with their mentor(s), and revising their contributions based on feedback in a timely manner.

Week 7 Theme
------------

The theme for this week is "Modifying Expectations". Outreachy mentors and interns start the internship with a specific set of project goals. However, usually those goals need to be modified, and that's perfectly fine!

Delays to projects happen. Maybe your project turned out to be more complicated than you or your mentor anticipated. Maybe you needed to learn some concepts before you could tackle project tasks. Maybe the community documention wasn't up-to-date or was wrong. These are all perfectly valid reasons for projects to be a bit behind schedule, as long as you've been working full-time on the project.

In fact, free and open source contributors have to deal with these kinds of issues all the time. Projects often seem simple until you start working on them. Project timelines are ususally a very optimistic view of what could happen if everything goes exactly as planned. It often doesn't, but people still make optimistic plans:

Modifying your project timeline to set more realistic goals is a skill all contributors need to learn. We encourage you to discuss your project timeline with your mentor and make adjustments to it. Outreachy organizers view the internship as more like a fellowship. Project goals should be adjusted as needed, as long as the intern is putting in a full-time effort. You can view your original project timeline here:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'project-timeline' round_slug=current_round.slug community_slug=community.slug project_slug=project.slug applicant_username=intern_selection.applicant.applicant.account.username %}

Your goal for this week's blog post is to write a report about your progress on your project. Talk about what you accomplished so far. Talk about what goals too more time than expected. Talk about your modified goals for the second half of the internship.

See the detailed section below for more prompts.

Mentor & Intern Assignment
--------------------------

This week, we want Outreachy mentors and interns to review the original project timeline:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'project-timeline' round_slug=current_round.slug community_slug=community.slug project_slug=project.slug applicant_username=intern_selection.applicant.applicant.account.username %}

Make adjustments to the project goals to ensure you'll complete them before your internship ends. Outreachy organizers view the internship as more like a fellowship. As long as an intern is working full-time on a project, Outreachy organizers consider this a success. Outreachy internships should not be extended to meet a particular project goal. Interns are not required to continue working on their project after their internship ends. Some Outreachy interns do continue working as volunteers on their project, but it's completely optional.

Week 8 Mentor & Intern Chat
---------------------------

On {{ current_round.week_eight_chat_text_date }} UTC we will host a chat for both Outreachy interns and mentors:

{{ current_round.week_eight_timeline_chat_url }}

The internship is now half way done! Now is a good time to review your proposed project timeline with your mentor. Make changes to those plans, based on the progress you've made so far. That may mean you change your expectations around what you can accomplish.

We encourage interns to share one project goal that they thought would be easy and why it took more time to complete.

Mentors are encouraged to share a project or task of their own that took more time than expected to complete, and what they did to modify their expectations.

Share why you think you underestimated the complexity of the goal. Share what you've learned about how to better estimate the complexity of this kind of goal. Often times there was nothing you could have done to better estimate the time a task would have taken, and that's okay too!

Goals for Mentors
-----------------

Week 7 goals:

 - Review the original project timeline with your intern
 - Adjust future project goals if needed
 - Talk to your intern about a project where you needed to modify your goals or plans
