Outreachy week 3: Assignments for mentors & interns

Welcome to the third week of your Outreachy internship! We hope you're starting to get the hang of your internship. Please reach out to organizers@outreachy.org if you need additional help!

We have some goals and assignments for both mentors and interns. Please read the sections below.

Week 3 Theme
------------

The theme for this week is "Everybody Struggles." When newcomers are working with experienced contributors, their mentors may seem perfect to them. Interns often see their mentors' contributions once they are ready for review. Interns don't always see their mentors put in long hours hunting down subtle mistakes in their contributions. Interns don't see the days their mentors spent searching documentation and forums for why something isn't working.

If we never acknowledge the effort and struggle we experience, other people may feel bad about getting stuck. They may hesitate to reach out when they need help. However, sometimes even the act of asking for help can solve your problem! Often when we start to write about what we're stuck on, or talk with another person about it, we end up figuring out something new to try or realizing what our issue was. Programmers often call this "rubber duck" debugging:

Part of the reason many people find free and open source software development intimidating is because they need to work in the open. The positive part of working in the open is that community contributors reach out to each other on public forums to get help when they're stuck. You can often learn a lot from watching two experienced contributors work through a tough problem together.

Week 4 Mentor & Intern Chat
---------------------------

On {{ current_round.week_four_chat_text_date }} UTC we will host a chat for both Outreachy interns and mentors. We encourage you to briefly share something you're currently stuck on. That includes mentors! We'll talk about different ways to get unstuck and how to seek help.
