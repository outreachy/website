Internship Agreement
--------------------

You will need to log into the Outreachy site and accept the Outreachy internship agreement by {{ current_round.intern_agreement_deadline }}:

https://www.outreachy.org/dashboard 

This is a legal document. You cannot participate in the internship unless you sign the internship agreement. The internship agreement asserts the information you provided on your initial and final application is accurate and correct. This includes the time commitments you provided on your initial application.

Make sure to email organizers@outreachy.org if your time commitments have changed or will change. Your time commitments can be viewed here:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'eligibility-results' %}

Legal Name
----------

You will need to provide your full legal name as your electronic signature on the internship agreement. You will also need to use your full legal name on your tax paperwork. Please make sure the names match.

Only Outreachy organizers (Marina, Sage, Karen, Cindy, and Tony) and Software Freedom Conservancy staff will see your legal name. You may use a nickname, pseudonym, or a shortened name for working with Outreachy mentors. You can also use a nickname, pseudonym, or shortened name for display on the Outreachy alums page.

Payment Accounting
------------------

Outreachy's fiscal sponsor, Software Freedom Conservancy, will be handling payment processing.

Conservancy uses an email-based accounting ticketing system. Please make sure to reply-all and keep the ticket number in the email subject line. If you try to contact individual Conservancy employees, that will not be recorded on the ticket, and it may slow down the processing of your accounting ticket.

Please treat Conservancy accounting staff with respect. The Outreachy Code of Conduct also applies to communication with Conservancy employees.

Payments schedule
-----------------

Your payments will be sent on the following schedule. See the Internship Guide for full details: http://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/#payments

 * The ${{ current_round.initialpayment }} initial payment will be issued by {{ current_round.initial_stipend_payment_deadline }}
 * The ${{ current_round.midpayment }} mid-point payment will be issued by {{ current_round.midpoint_stipend_payment_deadline }}
 * The ${{ current_round.finalpayment }} final payment will be issued by {{ current_round.final_stipend_payment_deadline }}

Your payments may be delayed if:

 * You do not turn in payment routing and tax forms by {{ current_round.tax_form_deadline }}
 * Your mentor does not provide feedback by the initial, mid-point, or final feedback deadlines
 * You have a custom internship start date or an internship extension

Tax forms
---------

Once the deadline to sign the internship agreement is passed ({{ current_round.intern_agreement_deadline }}), we will send the intern agreements to Conservancy. They will then email you to ask for tax forms.

Depending on the country you reside in, you will be asked to provide either a W-9 or a W8-BEN form.

Tax forms and payment routing information are due by {{ current_round.tax_form_deadline }}. Tax forms are required in order to be paid the internship stipend. You may be dropped from the program if you are asked for a form and you do not provide it within a month.

Internet Censorship Prep
---

All Outreachy interns need to take steps in order to prepare for the possibility of internet censorship.

Some Outreachy interns live in countries where the government can restrict internet access. This can impact your ability to work on your internship project, as popular sites like Gmail, GitHub, or GitLab may be blocked. Even if you think it's unlikely your internet will be censored, you can still help friends and other Outreachy participants if their internet is censored.

Please read the "Internet Censorship Preparedness" section in the Internship Guide:

http://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/#internet-censorship-prep

Travel Allowance
----------------

{% if current_round.internstarts|date:'Y-m-d' == '2020-12-01'%}All travel using the Outreachy travel stipend is prohibited. You will receive your travel stipend as part of your internship payment.{% else %}You have $500 travel allowance available to you for travel relevant to Outreachy. The travel allowance is good for one year from the date your internship starts. Please review the information at https://www.outreachy.org/travel-stipend

You will need to discuss the travel stipend with your mentor to determine which conference or event is most relevant to your internship. You mentor will need to approve the conference or event before you book your travel.

Please note that before you book any flights, you will need to take a screenshot of your flight search using a widely-recognized airfare comparison site, such as Orbitz, Kayak or Hipmunk. You should also double check before booking travel if you will need to seek pre-approval from the Outreachy organizers for the travel. https://www.outreachy.org/travel-stipend#preapproval If you don't need pre-approval, and your mentor approves the travel as relevant to your internship, there is no need to email the organizers before your travel.{% endif %}

Intern Blog
-----------

You are required to blog every two weeks about your internship. The Outreachy organizers will email you blog post prompts. Please see the Internship Guide for the blog post prompt schedule, and recommendations on how to set up your blog:

http://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/#blog

Please update your profile https://www.outreachy.org/account/ with a link to both the URL for your blog, and (optionally) the RSS feed for your blog.

Outreachy chat server
