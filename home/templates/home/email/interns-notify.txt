Internship Agreement
--------------------

You will need to log into the Outreachy site and accept the Outreachy internship agreement by {{ current_round.intern_agreement_deadline }}:

https://www.outreachy.org/dashboard 

This is a legal document. You cannot participate in the internship unless you sign the internship agreement. The internship agreement asserts the information you provided on your initial and final application is accurate and correct. This includes the time commitments you provided on your initial application.

Make sure to email organizers@outreachy.org if your time commitments have changed or will change. Your time commitments can be viewed here:

https://www.outreachy.org/eligibility-results/

Legal Name
----------

You will need to provide your full legal name as your electronic signature on the internship agreement. You will also need to use your full legal name on your tax paperwork. Please make sure the names match.

Only Outreachy organizers (Marina, Sage, Karen, Cindy, and Tony) and Software Freedom Conservancy staff (Bradley, Brett, and Rosanne) will see your legal name. You may use a nickname, pseudonym, or a shortened name for working with Outreachy mentors. You can also use a nickname, pseudonym, or shortened name for display on the Outreachy alums page.

Time Commitment
---------------

Unless contrary to any laws where you are located, you should dedicate 40 hours per week to your project for at least 12 weeks of the Outreachy internship's 13 week duration. If you should need to not work on your project for a period of time, please see details in the Internship Guide: https://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/#time-commitment

Payment Accounting
------------------

Outreachy's fiscal sponsor, Software Freedom Conservancy, will be handling payment processing.

Conservancy uses an email-based accounting ticketing system. Please make sure to reply-all and keep the ticket number in the email subject line. If you try to contact individual Conservancy employees, that will not be recorded on the ticket, and it may slow down the processing of your accounting ticket.

Please treat Conservancy accounting staff with respect. The Outreachy Code of Conduct also applies to communication with Conservancy employees.

Payments schedule
-----------------

Your payments will be sent on the following schedule. See the Internship Guide for full details: http://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/#payments

 * The ${{ current_round.initialpayment }} initial payment will be issued by {{ current_round.initial_stipend_payment_deadline }}
 * The ${{ current_round.midpayment }} mid-point payment will be issued by {{ current_round.midpoint_stipend_payment_deadline }}
 * The ${{ current_round.finalpayment }} final payment will be issued by {{ current_round.final_stipend_payment_deadline }}

Your payments may be delayed if:

 * You do not turn in payment routing and tax forms by {{ current_round.tax_form_deadline }}
 * Your mentor does not provide feedback by the initial, mid-point, or final feedback deadlines
 * You have a custom internship start date or an internship extension

Tax forms
---------

Once the deadline to sign the internship agreement is passed ({{ current_round.intern_agreement_deadline }}), we will send the intern agreements to Conservancy. They will then email you to ask for tax forms.

Depending on the country you reside in, you will be asked to provide either a W-9 or a W8-BEN form.

Tax forms and payment routing information are due by {{ current_round.tax_form_deadline }}. Tax forms are required in order to be paid the internship stipend. You may be dropped from the program if you are asked for a form and you do not provide it within a month.

Travel Allowance
----------------

You have $500 travel allowance available to you for travel relevant to Outreachy. The travel allowance is good for one year from the date your internship starts. Please review the information at https://www.outreachy.org/travel-stipend

You will need to discuss the travel stipend with your mentor to determine which conference or event is most relevant to your internship. You mentor will need to approve the conference or event before you book your travel.

Please note that before you book any flights, you will need to take a screenshot of your flight search using a widely-recognized airfare comparison site, such as Orbitz, Kayak or Hipmunk. You should also double check before booking travel if you will need to seek pre-approval from the Outreachy organizers for the travel. https://www.outreachy.org/travel-stipend#preapproval If you don't need pre-approval, and your mentor approves the travel as relevant to your internship, there is no need to email the organizers before your travel.

Intern Blog
-----------

You are required to blog every two weeks about your internship. The Outreachy organizers will email you blog post prompts. Please see the Internship Guide for the blog post prompt schedule, and recommendations on how to set up your blog:

http://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/#blog

Please update your profile https://www.outreachy.org/account/ with a link to both the URL for your blog, and (optionally) the RSS feed for your blog.

E-mails for coordinators and mentors
------------------------------------

mentors@lists.outreachy.org is a private list for all of the program's coordinators and mentors. It may include past coordinators and mentors.

organizers@outreachy.org is an email shared by the coordinators of the program (Cindy Pallares, Karen Sandler, Tony Sebro, Sage Sharp, and Marina Zhurakhinskaya).

Please feel free to e-mail either address if you have any general questions about the program at any time. Please always e-mail the list or the alias, and not one of us individually. Keep the list or the alias on CC in subsequent discussion, to ensure you get a faster response and all of us are in the loop. For the questions specific to your organization, please contact your mentor, the organization's coordinator or a relevant mailing list.

Outreachy chat server
---------------------

You will receive an invitation to a private Outreachy chat server. The chat server includes all accepted interns for this round, Outreachy mentors, coordinators, and organizers. The chat server is meant for you to connect on a person level to other Outreachy participants. You should still also participate in the public communication channels for your project and community.

If you haven't received an email invitation to the Outreachy chat server in a week, please let the Outreachy organizers know.

Outreachy opportunities
---------------------

Outreachy wants to ensure you find additional opportunities. We have an opportunities mailing list that is open to sponsors, current interns, alumni, and current and past mentors of Outreachy. Members are encouraged to post job opportunities, other internship programs, conference speaking calls for proposals, and conference travel grant opportunities.

https://lists.outreachy.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/opportunities

You can also see a list of sponsor job pages here:
