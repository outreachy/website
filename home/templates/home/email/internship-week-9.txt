Outreachy week 9: Assignments for mentors & interns

Welcome to week nine of your Outreachy internship! Now is a good time to start thinking about your career path after the Outreachy internship.

We have some goals and assignments for both mentors and interns. Please read the sections below.

Travel stipend
--------------

If you haven't discussed with your mentor how you could use the Outreachy travel stipend, now is a good time to do so! Conferences and events are a great way to network and find new opportunities.

Both you and your mentor(s) should carefully read Outreachy's travel stipend policy:

Week 9 Theme
------------

The theme for this week is "Career opportunities".

Some Outreachy interns may not know what they want to do with their career. Other Outreachy interns may be switching careers, and not know how to break into a new field. There may be Outreachy interns who took time off from their career to raise kids, and want to get back to work.

It's important to talk to your mentor, coordinators, and Outreachy organizers about what career opportunities are possible. If you don't ask for help finding opportunities, you may miss one! We'll have an Outreachy chat to share career opportunities.

Your goal for this week's blog post is to write a post about what direction you want your career to go. You may want to wait to publish the post until after you participate in next week's chat, since your goals might change!

Week 10 Mentor & Intern Chat
----------------------------

For this chat, we're also inviting past Outreachy interns to participate!

On {{ current_round.week_ten_chat_text_date }} UTC we will host a chat for Outreachy interns, alums, and mentors:

{{ current_round.week_ten_career_chat_url }}

We'll be discussing all the different ways you can advance your career by participating in free software. The discussion will have two parts.

The first part of the discussion will be everyone brainstorming different career paths in the technology industry and free software. Many people have part-time or full-time jobs working in the technology industry. Some people may be self-employed contractors, paid to work on free software. People may have taken a while to find a job. They may have participated in other internship programs, volunteer opportunities, grants, or networked at conferences and events.

We encourage everyone to share their stories of how they advanced their career. What did you try that didn't work? Where did you hear about opportunities? How did you network and connect with people who helped you advance your goals?

The second part of the discussion is brainstorming additional opportunities to work on free software. We encourage both mentors and interns to provide information about paid opportunities, but information about unpaid opportunities is also welcome. Sharing information about resource groups or job posting boards is also encouraged.

After the chat, you can help Outreachy organizers spread the word about these opportunities. You can update the Outreachy website opportunities page by sending a GitHub pull request:
