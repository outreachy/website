<h1>Feedback #1 on {{ feedback1frommentor.intern_selection.applicant.applicant.public_name }}</h1>

<p>Outreachy organizers collect intern feedback from mentors four times during the Outreachy internship.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Please give yourself at least 5 to 15 minutes to complete this form.</p>

<p>Only one mentor can submit feedback for one intern. If you are co-mentoring an intern, please talk with your co-mentor to decide what your feedback should be.</p>

<p>Once you submit this form and you mark your intern as being able to be paid, the form cannot be edited. If you ask for an extension for this internship milestone, you will be able to update your answers after the extension is complete.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>Your answers will only be seen by Outreachy organizers, your community coordinators, and Software Freedom Conservancy accounting staff. Your intern will be able to see when you submit your feedback to us, but will not be able see what the feedback is. If Outreachy organizers need to discuss your feedback with your intern, we will draft a response with you before contacting your intern.</p>

<h2>Metrics for Success</h2>

<p>The most important metric for success is whether your intern is putting in the minimum internship time commitment. Please see the temporary policy below for a definition of "minimum time commitment."</p>

<p>If an intern isn't putting in the minimum internship time commitment, we use the other metrics to come up with a plan to get the intern back on track. We also gather metrics about mentor engagement to ensure success for all Outreachy mentors.</p>
