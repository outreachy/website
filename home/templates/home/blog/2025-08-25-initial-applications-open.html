			<p>What is open source? Open source software means anyone has the freedom to collaborate with others to improve code.</p>

<h2 id='whats-different-this-round'><a href='#whats-different-this-round'>What’s Different This Round?</a></h2>

<p>Outreachy has several changes this cohort:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There will be 1-3 fewer internships available this cohort, due to Outreachy's financial situation</li>
	<li>Additional Outreachy program activities during the internship will be changed or cut, see details below</li>
	<li>Outreachy has set a policy that <a href="{% url 'docs-applicant' %}#generative-ai">generative AI should not be used in initial applications</a></li>
	<li>Each Outreachy mentor will set <a href="{% url 'docs-applicant' %}#generative-ai">rules about whether they allow generative AI in project contributions</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id='note-on-outreachys-financial-situation'><a href='#note-on-outreachys-financial-situation'>A Note on Outreachy’s Financial Situation</a></h2>

<p>We want to be transparent with you: Outreachy is currently facing a serious financial challenge. As shared in our previous updates, we’ve been navigating funding difficulties that directly impact how many interns and communities we can support.</p>

<p>As a result of our financial difficulties, Outreachy cannot fund as many interns as we did in the past. There will be 1-3 fewer interns accepted this cohort.</p>

<p>To lower program costs, Outreachy is cutting some program activities during the internship period. Instead of having text-based internship chats every two weeks, we will have a video-based social hour three times during the internship. Instead of asking interns to write blog posts every two weeks, interns will be required to write a project report blog post three times during the internship. Outreachy is cutting back on activities that help interns find open source community members to have informal career chats with. We highly encourage interns to talk with their mentors to help them set up informal chats.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id='why-you-should-still-apply'><a href='#why-you-should-still-apply'>Why You Should Still Apply</a></h3>

<p>Despite these challenges, we remain deeply committed to our mission: To open doors for underrepresented individuals in open source.</p>

<p>If you see a project that interests you and matches your skills or learning goals:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Give it your best shot.</li>
	<li>Show curiosity, dedication, and a willingness to grow.</li>
	<li>Ask thoughtful questions, learn actively, and stay engaged throughout the contribution period.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many past Outreachy interns began with little experience in open source. What set them apart was genuine interest, consistent effort, and a commitment to learning.</p> 

<p>This is your chance to take that first step.</p>

<h2 id='non-student-eligibility'><a href='#non-student-eligibility'>👩🏾‍💻 Non-student eligibility policy</a></h2>

<p>
You do not have to be a student to apply to Outreachy!
Outreachy is open to people who are not students.
</p>

<p>
You do not need a university degree to apply to Outreachy.
Many Outreachy interns learned their skills through online resources.
</p>

<p>
Please read our full <a href="{% url 'eligibility-information' %}#rules">eligibility guidelines</a>.
</p>

<h2 id='student-eligibility'><a href='#student-eligibility'>👩🏿‍🏫 Student eligibility policy</a></h2>

<p>
Outreachy has some special eligibility rules for students.
If you are (or will be) a student, please read the sections below.
</p>

<h3 id='hemisphere-rules'><a href='#hemisphere-rules'>Which cohort should students apply to?</a></h3>

<p>
Outreachy runs twice a year, May to August and December to March.
</p>

<p>
Students in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere">northern hemisphere</a> should apply to the June internship cohort.
</p>

<p>
Students in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere">southern hemisphere</a> should apply to the December 2025 internship cohort.
</p>

<p>
We consider India to be in the northern hemisphere, regardless of where the university is located.
Otherwise, if your university is near the equator, you are welcome to apply to either cohort.
</p>

<h3 id='graduating-students'><a href='#graduating-students'>What if I'm graduating?</a></h3>

<p>If you are completing your last term for your degree, you are only eligible for the internship cohort designated to students of the hemisphere where your school is located.</p>

<h3 id='no-student-policy-exceptions'><a href='#no-student-policy-exceptions'>Do you grant exceptions to these policies?</a></h3>

<p>In order to apply our policies fairly, we do not grant exceptions to the student policies listed above.</p>

<p>When determining student eligibility, Outreachy considers the hemisphere of the school's location. We do not consider the individual student's course load. We do not consider special arrangements students have made with their university. Students who plan on taking a school term off to pursue an internship are not eligible for Outreachy. We cannot accept letters from universities about pausing classes or joining classes at a later date.</p>
