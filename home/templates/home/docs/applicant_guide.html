<h2 id='what-is-outreachy'><a href='#what-is-outreachy'>What is Outreachy?</a></h2>

<p>Outreachy is a paid, remote internship program. Outreachy's goal is to support people from groups underrepresented in tech. We help newcomers to free software and open source make their first contributions.</p>

<p>Outreachy provides internships to work open source. People apply from all around the world. Interns work remotely, and are not required to move. Interns are paid a stipend of $7,000 USD for the three month internship.</p>

<p>Interns work with experienced mentors from open source communities. Outreachy internship projects may include programming, user experience, documentation, illustration, graphical design, or data science. Interns often find employment after their internship with Outreachy sponsors or in jobs that use the skills they learned during their internship.</p>

<h2 id='what-is-free-software'><a href='#what-is-free-software'>What is free software and open source?</a></h2>

<p>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is software that gives the user the freedom to use, copy, study, change, and improve it. We encourage you to <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">read an introduction article about open source software</a>.</p>

<p>Open source projects are built collaboratively. Open source contributors work together publicly. Working publicly creates a fun collaborative community around a project. It allows anyone to make innovative changes that reach many people.</p>

<p>Open source contributors work on a lot of different things! You can contribute by developing software. Or you might want to improve user experience by contributing design work. You can help with documentation, community management, marketing, identifying issues and reporting bugs, helping users, event organization, graphic design, and translations.</p>

<p>Sometimes people work on open source in their spare time. Many contributors are employed by companies and non-profit organizations to work on open source. That includes the companies that are sponsoring Outreachy!  Experience with open source is highly valuable in the professional world. Your contributions to open source provide a public portfolio for you. Employers can see your history of public collaboration, which will give them confidence when making hiring decisions.</p>

<h3>Outreachy Eligibility Rules</h3>

<p>These eligibility rules apply to the {{ current_round.official_name }} round. Dates may change for future rounds.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='am-i-experienced-enough'><a href='#am-i-experienced-enough'>Am I experienced enough?</a></h2>

<p>Outreachy organizers often get questions from applicants like:</p>

<div class="container ml-3">

<p><i>"I'm a second year university student. I have done some projects in X programming language. Am I experienced enough for this internship?"</i></p>

<p><i>"I'm learning Y through online courses. But I haven't worked on a big project with those skills. Am I experienced enough for this internship?"</i></p>

</div>

<p>The answer is <b>"You should fill out an initial application, regardless of your experience level."</b></p>

<p>Outreachy has many different internship projects. Each project will have different skill requirements. It is likely there will be at least one project that fits your skills.</p>

<h3 id='project-skill-preferences'><a href='#project-skill-preferences'>Project skill preferences</a></h3>

<p>Each project will list the required, preferred, and bonus skills:</p>

{% include 'home/snippet/skill_preference_key.html' %}

<p>When deciding whether to apply to a project, you should focus on looking at the required skills. If you have experience in at least 1 or 2 required skills for a project, you are welcome to apply to it. If you do not have the preferred or bonus skills, it is okay to apply. However, if another applicant has the preferred skills, they may be selected over you.</p>

<p>Applicants show mentors they have the required project skills by completing project tasks during the contribution period. You are more likely to be accepted as an intern if you <a href="#make-contributions">make high-quality contributions</a>.</p>

<p><a href='#toc'><u>↑ table of contents</u></a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id='non-programming-projects'><a href='#non-programming-projects'>Do I have to be a programmer to apply?</a></h2>

<p>No, you do not need to be a programmer to apply to Outreachy. Some Outreachy projects are focused on non-programming work. Those projects may involve design, documentation, user experience, marketing, or event planning.</p>

<p>However, the majority of Outreachy projects will require that you have some programming skills. You will need experience programming to apply for those projects.</p>

<p>Sometimes mentors are willing to teach you a new programming language if you know at least one other programming language. Check the project skills list for an experience level listing of '1 - No knowledge required'.</p>

<p><a href='#toc'><u>↑ table of contents</u></a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id='project-types'><a href='#project-types'>Do you have the type of project I'm interested in?</a></h2>

<p>Some applicants are looking for a specific type of project. They may want to find a project that fits their current skills. Or they may want to find a project that will challenge them to learn new skills.</p>

<p>Outreachy organizers often get asked:</p>

<div class="container ml-3">

<p><i>"I'm interested in internships involving X. Will you have internship projects involving X?"</i></p>

<p><i>"I know Y programming language. Will you have Y internship projects?"</i></p>

</div>

<p>The answer is <b>"You should fill out an initial application, regardless of whether you see a project you're interested in."</b></p>

<p>Some applicants want to wait until a project appears on the <a href="{% url 'project-selection' %}">project list</a> before they fill out an initial application. However, mentors often list their project after the initial application deadline. It's important you fill out an initial application, even if you don't see a project you're interested in.</p>

	<li><p><b>Are you part of an underrepresented group (in the technology industry of the country listed above)? How are you underrepresented?</b></p>
					<p>
					Think about the technology industry in the country listed above.
					</p>
					<p>
					Are there few people who share your identity or background in that technology industry?
					</p>
					<p>
					Please tell us which underrepresented groups you are a part of.
					You may want to consider your:
					</p>

					<p><ul>
						<li>age</li>

	</li>

	<li><p><b>What systemic bias or discrimination would you face if you applied for a job in the technology industry of your country?</b> Think about when you have applied for a job in the technology industry of your country. Do you think you have faced discrimination on the basis of your background or identity? If you have not applied for a job yet, do you think you may be discriminated against on the basis of your background or identity? Please provide specific examples and (optionally) statistics. Outreachy Organizers strongly encourage you to write your personal stories. We want you to know that we won't judge your writing style, grammar or spelling.</p></li>

	<li><p><b>Does your learning environment have few people who share your identity or background? Please provide details.</b> Contributing to free and open source software takes some skill. You may have already learned some basic skills through university or college classes, specialized schools, online classes, online resources, or with a mentor, friend, family member or co-worker. Does any of your learning environments have few people who share your identity or background? How did your identity or background differ from the majority of people in this learning environment? Outreachy Organizers strongly encourage you to write your personal stories. We want you to know that we won't judge your writing style, grammar or spelling.</p></li>

	<li><p><b>What systemic bias or discrimination have you faced while building your skills?</b> Outreachy projects often require applicants to know some basic skills. Those skills might include programming, user experience, documentation, illustration and graphical design, or data science. You may have already learned some basic skills through university or college classes, specialized schools, online classes, online resources, or with a mentor, friend, family member or co-worker. In these settings, have you faced systemic bias or discrimination? Have you been discouraged from accessing these resources because of your identity or background? Please provide specific examples and (optionally) statistics. Outreachy Organizers strongly encourage you to write your personal stories. We want you to know that we won't judge your writing style, grammar or spelling.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>(Optional) Content warnings.</b> Some essays may talk about very harsh or hard things. That's okay. There's no need to change your essay. It can help us to know what harsh or hard topics are in your essay. These are called "content warnings". Content warnings can be one or two words. Examples include: "violence", "sexual assault", or "war". Content warnings help reviewers mentally prepare to read your essay. Thank you for your help! If you do you not talk about harsh or hard things in your essays, leave this field blank.</p></li>

<h2 id='legal-names'>Legal names in Outreachy</h2>

<p>Outreachy interns must fill out three forms:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="{% url 'account' %}">Outreachy Code of Conduct</a></li>
	<li>W-9 or W8-BEN tax form</li>
	<li>Payment information</li>
</ol>

<p>
Interns must put their legal names on these forms. Some interns may be worried about using their legal name. Outreachy organizers understand your worries. Outreachy supports transgender and non-binary people. Outreachy supports domestic violence survivors. Outreachy supports people who wish to avoid using their legal name on the internet.
</p>

<p>
Outreachy supports intern privacy. Mentors and coordinators will not know your legal name. Forms that require your legal name will not be shared with mentors and coordinators.
</p>

<p>
The Outreachy website <a href="{% url 'account' %}">account preferences</a> will allow you to set a "public name". This public name will be displayed to mentors and coordinators. It will also be displayed on the <a href="{% url 'alums' %}">alums page</a> if you are selected as an intern. You can set your "public name" to a shortened name, a pseudonym, or your name that affirms your gender identity.

<p><img src="{% static 'bot-find-a-mentor.png' %}" class="img-fluid"></p>

<p>
Once your initial application is approved, the contribution period will open.
The next step in the Outreachy application process is to look through the list of
participating communities and internship projects. Pick one
or two projects that look interesting to you.
</p>

<p>
We don't recommend applying to more than two projects.
</p>

<p>
Many people want to increase their chances of getting accepted.
They see some communities that are accepting many interns,
and some communities that are accepting one or two interns.
Their instinct is to apply to the communities that are accepting more interns.
However, when all the applicants think that way, it means
projects that are only accepting one intern don't get a lot of
applicants. It might be better to apply to a community who is accepting a small number of interns.
</p>

<p>
Projects will list the skills they want applicants to have.
Project skills are listed with two different indicators:
how much experience you need in a skill, and whether
you are required to have that skill in order to apply.
Please
<a href="{% url 'project-selection' %}#project-skills-key">see the project skills key</a>
on the project list for more information.
</p>

<p>
Many people get overwhelmed with the list of projects and don't
know how to choose a project! Our advice is to pick a community
that has a mission that you're passionate about.
</p>

<p>
Once you've narrowed down your list of projects,
you can decide whether the project is right for you by:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Introducing yourself to the project's mentor via email</li>
	<li>Joining the project's chat, forums, or mailing list and introducing yourself</li>
	<li>Using or installing the project</li>
	<li>Reading the project's documentation</li>
	<li>Looking at the open issues or feature requests for the project</li>
	<li><a href="/alums/">Reading Outreachy alums' blogs</a> who worked with that community</li>
</ul>

<p><b>You'll need to contact the project mentor.</b> All applicants need to be the first one to reach out to mentors. Mentors will not be assigned to you.</p>

<p>
The mentors listed on the project will be the mentors who you are working with during the internship period.
Mentors will evaluate applicants on their communication skills and the quality of the contributions they make during the contribution period. They'll pick the strongest applicant as their intern. Therefore, it's important that you reach out to mentors early during the contribution period.</p>

<p>Applicants ask all sorts of questions of their mentors! Mentors are friendly and patient, and it's okay to ask questions multiple times, or multiple times a day! Read the project description, and ask your mentor questions about anything that's unclear. Ask you mentor if you get stuck setting up your contribution environment. Look for a list of project tasks under the 'Project Contribution Information' and ask questions if you have trouble getting started on your contributions. If you're stuck for more than a couple of hours at any time, reach out to your mentor for help.

<h2 id='make-contributions'><a href="#make-contributions">Making Contributions</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://www.outreachy.org/media/images/bot-contribution.original.png" class="img-fluid"></p>

<p><b>What is a Contribution?</b></p>

<p>
To 'contribute' means 'To give to a common cause, often along with other people'.
In free software and open source, we talk about 'contributing' to a project or community.
That means people working together to improve an open source project.
People who regularly work on open source are often called 'open source contributors'.
</p>

<p>
Outreachy applicants will become open source contributors during the contribution period!
When you work on an Outreachy project task, you're making a 'contribution' to that project.
A contribution can be something small, like a bug fix or a documentation improvement.
</p>

<p><b>Applicants are required to make a contribution.</b></p>

<p>
Outreachy applicants are required to make at least one contribution to an Outreachy project.
Only applicants who make a contribution will be eligible to be selected as an intern.
Applicants are required to record their contributions in the Outreachy website.
You can't submit a final application until you record a contribution.
</p>

<p>
Start your contributions early!
Many applicants under-estimate the time it will take to complete a contribution.
Most applicants take 5 to 10 days to complete their first contribution.
</p>

<p>
Some project mentors find that they have many promising applicants.
They may choose to close their project to new applicants.
If you wait too long to start, your project may be closed to new applicants.
</p>

<p>
Don't try to make a big, last minute contribution.
Keep in contact with your mentors throughout the whole contribution period.
Ask questions and send contributions at a steady pace.
</p>

<p>
Start with a smaller contribution.
Then try a more complex contribution.
The end goal is to show you have the skills to be a successful intern.
</p>

<p><b>How do I find a contribution to work on?</b></p>

<p>
Project mentors have a list of tasks for applicants to work on.
You can find the task list in the project details page, which is linked from the <a href="{% url 'project-selection' %}">project selection page</a>.
The project description should include a section called 'Project Contribution Information'.
That should have information about how to find a contribution to work on.
</p>

<p>
Some projects, like the Linux Kernel, want people to contribute in a specific way.
They may have a tutorial for setting up your environment and creating your first contribution.
The project description or community description should mention a tutorial.
</p>

<p>
Some mentors have each applicant work on different tasks.
Other mentors have each applicant complete the same task.
</p>

<p>
Some project issue trackers have a tagging system.
Mentors may tag tasks that are good for newcomers to the project.
Some common tag names are "first patch" or "newcomers welcome" or "newcomer friendly".
</p>

<p>
When in doubt, ask the project mentor!
It's good to ask for suggestions when looking for a suitable contribution.
Make sure to describe what your skills are and what you want to learn more about.
</p>

<p id='record-contributions'><b>Recording your contributions</b></p>

<p>
Applicants are required to record their contributions in the Outreachy website.
Only applicants who have recorded a contribution will be allowed to submit a final application.
</p>

<p>
You can record a contribution as soon as you start working on it.
You can go back and edit your recorded contribution at any time.
</p>

<p>
You can find a link to record a contribution on the project details page.
Go to the <a href="{% url 'project-selection' %}">Outreachy project list</a>,
and click the link for your project.
On the page with project details, you should see a link to
'record your contributions and create a final application'.
</p>

<p><b>Getting help on a contribution</b></p>

<p>
Working on contributions can be confusing at times!
It is expected and perfectly normal to have questions.
Mentors are here to help.
</p>

<p>
If you get stuck for more than a couple hours, ask the project mentors or community for help.
If you ask for help privately and don't get an answer, try asking on the public community channels as well.
If you ask for help publicly and don't get an answer, try emailing the mentor.
</p>

<p>
Contributions to open source communities are submitted and reviewed in the public.
That can feel intimidating at first, but remember that mentors are here to help you!
</p>

<p><b>Contribution review and revisions</b></p>

<p>
After you submit a contribution, your mentor or another community member will review it.
They will often have feedback and changes you'll need to make.
This is not a criticism of your work or skills.
You should view it as a chance to learn something new and improve your skills.
</p>

<p>
Please be sure to follow up on the reviewer's feedback.
You may need to submit your contribution several times.
Keep working on it with your mentor until it is ready to be included in the project.
It's best to allocate time over several weeks for this process.
Try to start you contributions as soon as possible.
</p>

<p><b>How Much Should I Contribute?</b></p>

<p>
Applicants are only required to make one contribution.
However, we find that the strongest applicants make multiple contributions.
Start with a small contribution and work your way up to more complex contributions.
The strongest applicants are consistent about working on the project.
They communicate regularly with their mentor to discuss what they're working on.
</p>

<p>
Applicants are encouraged, but not required, to contribute after the contribution period ends.
</p>

<h2 id='contribution-evaluation'><a href="#contribution-evaluation">How are contributions evaluated?</a></h2>

<p>
Each Outreachy mentor will evaluate contributions in a different way.
It depends on what skills the applicant needs to be successful for their project.
A programming project might want applicants to add code.
A design project might want applicants to create graphics or art.
</p>

<p>
This applicant guide will generalize for all projects.
When in doubt, ask your mentor how they evaluate contributions.
Ask your mentor how they decide which applicant to accept as an intern.
Any guidance your mentor provides should be followed, even if it differs from the Outreachy applicant guide.
</p>

<p>
Here are some example questions that mentors may use to evaluate your contributions:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Do your contributions show you have the required skills for the project?</li>
	<li>Have your contributions shown you can complete complex work?</li>
	<li>Have you worked on contributions that your mentor asked you to work on? Have you worked on contributions that are on the community's task list for Outreachy interns?</li>
	<li>Have you tried using new tools or techniques? Your mentor may have some suggestions for tools, or you may find new open source tools on your own.</li>
	<li>Have you communicated with your mentor via the public community chat?</li>
	<li>Do you communicate in a clear, welcoming, and professional manner?</li>
	<li>Have you asked for help when stuck in a timely manner?</li>
	<li>Do you share your knowledge and help other applicants when they get stuck? Open source is about collaborating with other community members, and that includes other applicants and interns.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='estimated-number-of-interns'><a href="#estimated-number-of-interns">Estimated number of interns</a></h2>

<p>
On the <a href="{% url 'project-selection' %}">project list</a>, each community has an estimate of the number of interns it expects to accept.
The estimated number of interns is the total number of interns that will be accepted for the whole community.
It is not the number of interns per project.
</p>

<p>
The estimated number of interns is based on the amount of sponsorship for the community and the number of mentors a community has.
</p>

<p>
The number of interns per community is an estimate, not a hard-and-fast rule.
It may increase or decrease during the intern selection period.
The reasons for changing are community-specific.
</p>

<p><b>Communities accepting more interns</b></p>

<p>
Some communities will accept more interns than they estimated.
This typically means the community has found more funding to pay intern stipends,
and has enough mentors to support additional interns.
</p>

<p>
Some times communities find additional sponsors, or they ask current sponsors for more money.
Other times communities request funding from the Outreachy general fund.
</p>

<p><b>Communities accepting less interns</b></p>

<p>
Some communities may accept less interns than they expected.
Some communities may accept no interns at all.
</p>

<p>
Some times communities accept less interns because of a change in mentor free time.
Mentors may decide they do not have enough free time during the internship.
This could be because of personal reasons, like burn out, a medical condition, or a death in the family.
Or mentors could find they simply over-estimated the amount of free time they have.
</p>

<p>
Some times project mentors <a href="#contribution-evaluation">evaluated the contributions</a> and decided not to accept any applicants.
</p>

<p>
Some times community coordinators make decisions about which applicants to accept.
They may prioritize a stronger applicant for one project over a weaker applicant for a different project.
</p>

<p>
Please show mentors respect who decide not to accept an intern.
Mentors may not have time to provide individual feedback to all applicants who were not accepted, although some do.
You are welcome to ask a mentor for feedback to improve your contributions next time.
Please make sure you are asking for feedback in a constructive manner, and not trying to appeal the decision.
</p>

<p>
Please don't ask Outreachy organizers why you were not accepted as an intern.
They do not work directly with applicants, and often do not know why mentors did not accept an intern.

<h2 id='final-application'><a href='#final-application'>Final application</a></h2>

<p>Applicants are required to create a final application for each Outreachy project they apply to.
Only applicants that <a href='#record-contributions'>record a contribution</a> to a project will be able to create a final application for that project.
</p>

<p>
We encourage applicants to submit their final application at least a day before the deadline ({{ current_round.contributions_close }} at 4pm UTC).
You can edit your final application until the deadline.
</p>

<p>You will need to submit your final application through the Outreachy website. 
Go to the <a href="{% url 'project-selection' %}">Outreachy project list</a>,
and click the link for your project.
On the page with project details, you should see a link to
'record your contributions and create a final application'.
</p>

<p>The final application asks four questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Past experience with this community.</b> Please describe your experience before this Outreachy application period with this free software community. You can describe your prior experiences as both a user and a contributor.</li>
	<li><b>Past experience with other communities.</b> Please describe your experience before this Outreachy application period with any other free software communities. You can describe your prior experiences as both a user and a contributor.</li>
	<li><b>Relevant Projects</b> Please describe any relevant projects (either personal, work, or school projects) that helped you gain skills you will use in this project. Talk about what knowledge you gained from working on them. Include links where possible.</li>
	<li><b>(Optional) Please describe which Google Summer of Code communities and projects you are applying for, and provide mentor contact information.</b> If you are a student at an accredited university or college, we highly encourage you to also apply to <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> during the May to August internship round. Many Outreachy communities participate in both programs, and applying to Google Summer of Code increases your chances of being accepted as an intern. Please note that <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends">Google Summer of Code has stipend amounts that vary per country</a>. Please keep the list of communities and projects you are applying to under Google Summer of Code up-to-date, since we often try to coordinate with Google Summer of Code mentors during the intern selection period. If this application is for the December to March internship period, or you are not applying to Google Summer of Code, please leave this question blank.</li>
	<li><b>Outreachy internship project timeline.</b> Please work with your mentor to provide a timeline of the work you plan to accomplish on the project and what tasks you will finish at each step. Make sure take into account any time commitments you have during the Outreachy internship round. If you are still working on your contributions and need more time, you can leave this blank and edit your application later.</li>
