## Example impact stories

Quote from an open science Outreachy mentor:
 - Required:
   - [Bioconductor mentor blog post](https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2025-02-26-outreachy-mentoring/)
   - Name of intern: Scholastica Urua
   - Internship cohort: May 2024
   - Community they interned with: Bioconductor
   - What did the Outreachy intern achieve? Scholastica won "best microtalk award" at the MVIF conference.
     
 - Optional:
   - 3 to 5 sentence quote: "I was deeply moved when one of my [Outreachy Bioconductor] mentees, Scholastica Urua, presented her research on African microbiome data at the MVIF conference. Scholastica’s talk exemplified the kind of collaborative science we aspire to–carefully documenting microbiome studies from regions that have historically been underrepresented in microbiome science databases. The community recognized Scholastica’s excellent work with the best microtalk award, but what truly mattered was her contribution helped make our database more globally representative. Scholastica together with [the Bioconductor] community demonstrated through their work that when we open doors to diverse perspectives in science, everyone benefits."
