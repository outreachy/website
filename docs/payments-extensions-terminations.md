# Payments, Extensions, and Terminations

Outreachy organizers view this internship as a fellowship. Our goal is to attract and retain people from marginalized groups in free software. Providing the intern a positive free software experience is more important than finishing their project.

## Payments

Outreachy mentors have to provide feedback on their interns four times during the internship period. On successful feedback, their intern is paid the stipend associated with that feedback check point (e.g. initial stipend, midpoint stipend, or final stipend).

Outreachy interns are paid according to the intern payment schedule, unless their internship is extended or their internship contract is terminated. If the internship is extended, the modified feedback and payment schedule will be visible on both the intern and mentor's dashboards.

Outreachy interns are paid by the Software Freedom Conservancy. Conservancy is Outreachy's fiscal sponsor and non-profit 501c3 parent organization.

Per the intern agreement, Outreachy interns are independent contractors for the Software Freedom Conservancy. They are not employees of either Outreachy, Software Freedom Conservancy, or any of Outreachy's sponsors.

## Internship Time Commitment

Interns are expected to work full-time on their internship project. If an intern is not working full-time, mentors may want to ask for an internship extension.

It can be hard to determine whether an intern is working full-time on their project. They may be spending a lot of time working on their own. They may be doing research, learning about new topics, trying out new tools, or spending time understanding community norms.

With that in mind, it can be hard to determine exactly how many hours they are working. Signs of full-time work include:

* Participating in weekly check-in meetings
* Asking questions
* Picking up new concepts
* Trying new tools
* Clarifying project goals
* Draft contributions, either publicly submitted or in personal repositories
* Asking for review on draft contributions

It is okay for interns to ask the same questions multiple times. The mentor may need to explain the concept a different way, or point the intern to different documentation or resources. The mentor may want to have a real time, phone, or video conversation to clarify any confusion.

It is okay for interns to take time to produce contributions. The mentor may need to encourage the intern to push draft contributions to a personal repository. The mentor may need to review those draft contributions more frequently to ensure the intern is on the right path.

It is okay for interns to spend time learning. Outreachy encourages interns to learn new skills, new concepts, and new tools. Interns may show they are learning by mentioning new things in conversations with mentors. The key is for interns to communicate what they are learning or researching. Then the mentor can ensure they have found the correct resources and the intern is on the right path.

## Adjusting Project Goals

Outreachy organizers prefer not to extend internships or terminate internship contracts if interns are putting in a full-time commitment.

Therefore, we ask that mentors be flexible in the project work they accept:

 * Mentors should not expect the project to be completed by the end of the internship
 * Mentors will adjust the internship goals to fit to the level of the intern's ability, their interests, and the project's priorities throughout the internship

If your intern is putting in a full-time effort, you should authorize payment of their initial stipend. Do not request an internship extension only to get the project completed. Interns may choose to volunteer their time after the internship is complete, but it is not required by Outreachy.

## Internship Extensions

If an intern is not working full-time, the first option Outreachy organizers recommend is extending the internship.

An internship extension causes the internship time to increase. For example, a 1 week internship extension moves the internship end date by 1 week, and the intern will work 14 weeks rather than the standard 13 weeks.

Internships can be extended at three times during the internship:

* During initial feedback
* During midpoint feedback
* During final feedback

An internship extension also moves the due dates of the mentor feedback by a similar amount. For example, if the internship was extended by 2 weeks at the midpoint feedback, then the final feedback due date be 2 weeks later, and the internship would end 2 weeks later.

During feedback, mentors say how long they want the internship extended for. An internship can be extended by up to five weeks total. If an intern is not putting in a full-time effort, mentors typically extend the internship by 1 or 2 weeks. That allows the mentor to set expectations and gives the intern time to get back on track.

After the internship extension is finished, mentors will fill out the feedback form again. At that time, they can choose to pay the intern stipend, extend the internship further, or terminate the internship.

## Tips for Extensions

There are several things mentors can do to help get the internship back on track:

* Set up a daily stand-up
* Have the intern state what they are working on every day
* Check in more frequently to see if the intern is blocked or stuck
* Set up a real-time private chat to discuss new concepts
* Set up a paired session to work on contributions together
* Review draft contributions more frequently to ensure the intern is on the right track
* Find a co-mentor who can be available during the intern's working hours
* Find a co-mentor who is more experienced in the area the intern is working in

When requesting an internship extension, the mentors should provide concrete goals the intern needs to meet. When those goals are met, the internship extension is considered successful and the intern will be paid their stipend.

A concrete plan to get the internship back on track may include:

* The intern communicating daily about what they are working on
* The intern asking for help when they are stuck for more than 1-3 hours
* The intern providing draft contributions more frequently
* The intern creating a draft contribution for a particular work item

## Internship Terminations

Outreachy organizers prefer not to terminate an internship contract. We typically do not terminate unless the intern has been given at least one internship extension and is still not putting in a full-time internship effort.

### Terminations & Internship Stipends

There are two ways to handle internship stipends when an internship contract is terminated:

* Pay the intern their stipend for the current feedback check point
* Do not pay the current intern stipend

For example, a mentor may give the intern an extension at the midpoint feedback. After working during the two week extension, the intern has put in enough effort to be paid the midpoint stipend. However, the intern is clearly not engaged in the work, and their communication frequency has not increased. The mentor feels it is likely the intern will not put in a full-time effort during the second half of the internship.

In this first case, the mentor may choose to terminate the internship. The mentor requests that the intern be paid the midpoint stipend. However, the intern will not be paid their final stipend.

Another example is a mentor giving an internship extension at the initial feedback. In this case, the intern has not been communicating with the mentor. They are not responsive to mentor emails. They have been skipping meetings. When asked if they have questions or need help, the intern says they are doing fine. The intern asks questions that show they have not read the documentation that the mentor pointed them to. The mentor thinks they are not working on the project at all.

In this second case, the mentor may choose to terminate the internship. The mentor requests that the intern not be paid the initial stipend. The intern will also not be paid the midpoint and final stipend.

### Discussing Internship Termination

We will discuss your request for this internship to be terminated with you before we contact your intern. We will work together to draft a response to your intern.

In some cases, interns may have draft contributions that have not been submitted, or they may have been spending time alone doing research. In this case, they may make an appeal that they have been working full-time on the internship. Depending on the circumstances, mentors may choose to continue with the internship. In this case, we need mentors to fill out the feedback form again, in order to authorize stipend payment or to record another internship extension.
